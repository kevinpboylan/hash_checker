# hash_checker
A bash script to check files against a given hash value
'hash_checker.sh' is the most up-to-date version

***
Used when you have a given hash value and a bunch of fles, and you want to check to see if any of the files match.  
***

***
USAGE:
./hash_checker directory path_to_text_file_with_target_hash_value
***

***
This was mostly made to practice bash scripting, specifically how to handle user input via arguments, for loops, and file/directory management. 
***

***
Features to add in the future:
-allowing user to choose what hashing algorithm to use 
  -sha256 vs md5, etc
***
